<h3> Patient and Records</h3>
      Doctors and hospitals need to keep accurate records of all their patients. This is<br>
      essential to ensure correct diagnosis and treatment. Databases are kept by doctora <br>
      and hospitals so that data can be shared between medical practitioners and pharmacies <br>

      The data required on a patient data base would be: <br>

      <ol>
        <li>A unique identification number</li>
        <li>Name and adress</li>
        <li>Data of birth</li>
        <li>Gender</li>
        <li>Medical history</li>
        <li>Blood group</li>
        <li> Any known allergies</li>
        <li>Doctor</li>
        <li> Any current treatment</li>
        <li>Any current diagnosis</li>
        <li> Important additional information (X-rays or CT scans</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Use o 3D printers</h3>
    3D printers were first introduced in Chapter 3. Their use in a number of fields is rapidly<br>
    progressing. One of the most innovative uses is in the field of medicine. The following<br>
    is just a small insight into the many developments taking place acroos the world.<br>
    A 3D printer can then produce a three-dimensional representation of a patien internal<br>
    organs, blood vessels, major arteries, tumours and so on. The doctor can use this to show <br>
    the patient exactly what is wrong and then show them what procedures are required. <br>
    <h3> Prosthetics</h3>
    3D printers are now being used to print out prosthetics such as false arms, hands and legs.<br>
    While state-of-the-art myoelectric prosthetics cost tens of thousands of dollars, the price<br>
    for 3D-printing a prosthetic arm or handcan be as little as $100.<br>
    <h3>Tissue engineering</h3>
    Recent advances have allowed the 3D printing of bio-compatible materials, cells and supporting<br>
    structures. This has enabled the viability of producing artificial cells and tissues within 3D<br>
    printed object.
